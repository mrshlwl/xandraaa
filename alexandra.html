To my first and last girlfriend,

  I am so grateful for having you
in my life. You are the only reason 
why I want to live every day. Getting 
to know you was the best thing that 
ever happened to my entire life. 
Back then, I wanted to be yours 
so bad, but I knew you wouldn't 
like me back. I never expected 
that you would feel the same way as 
I do. If we have some misunderstandings, 
just know that it will never stop me 
from loving you. I will never disappoint 
you for choosing me. You will always 
be my priority. Thank you for being my 
girlfriend and thank you for choosing me... 
I love you, and I always will.

                 From, Marshallloverboy<33
